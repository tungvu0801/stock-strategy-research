api/server.py — FastAPI application entry point.

Run with (from the stock-agent/ directory, with the venv active):
    uvicorn api.server:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000 --reload

Serves the JSON API under /api/* and the static dashboard frontend at /.
Missing Alpaca credentials do NOT prevent the server from starting — the
dashboard shell still loads, and individual endpoints return a clear 503
until .env is filled in. This module never imports Alpaca's trading
client, so nothing here can place an order.
